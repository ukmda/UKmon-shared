About this app
==============
This application will upload images of meteors in realtime to the UKMON live site.
It is a "commandline tool" and when you run it you will get a text window with some logging and other information. As events are detected the window will be updated with what has been seen. 
You can minimise the window to your taskbar and it will keep running. 

Installation 
============
Run the installer. This will install the support libraries if needed and create a desktop icon and startup shortcut.

Configuration
=============
Upon first run, the app will update the ini file (or create a default configuration if you've never used the programme before).
You will need to set the ProcessingPath to point to the location of your files. 
To edit the config file, use the icon under UKMonLive on the start menu. 

Fireballs
=========
The [Fireballs] section of the config file controls whether the application will upload videos of fireballs. The videos 
are converted to MP4 and so are about 1-2MB in size. 
MinPxls is the threshold above which the app will upload a video. Study of the UKMON data indicates this is a good value. 
FFMpeg points to the location of ffmpeg, which is installed with the application. 

Filtering
=========
The software can filter out aircraft, faint meteors and flashes. This is enabled by default. 
Events shorter than FrameLimit or dimmer than MinBright will be ignored. Note that FrameLimit includes the 30 frames that UFO captures before and after every event so a limit of 65 means 'ignore events that last less than 5 frames'

XP Compatability
================
This application is not compatible with Windows XP or earlier. I'm sorry about that, but Microsoft ceased support for XP in in 2014 and completely rewrote the network stack for the next version. As a result the support libraries from AWS and indeed Microsoft are not available in backward-compatible versions.
