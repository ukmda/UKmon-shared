        <p><b>Fundraising</b></p>
        <p>Our Justgiving is now closed for 2023.</p>
        <p>
            However, if you'd still like to help with data analysis costs, you can donate
            directly via our bank account. This has the advantage that we are not charged administration fees by
            JustGiving, and also we are not taxed on the donations. As we're not a charity, Justgiving donations are treated as
            earnings of the person who sets up the fundraiser and are subject to tax at their marginal rate. 
            However, funds paid directly into our account can be 
            offset against costs with only the balance being taxed, if above the tax threshold.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in donating via our bank account please contact markmcintyre99 at googlemail.com for
            further
            details. </p>
        <p><b>What do we spend the money on? </b></p>
        <p>Each day we collect data from over 200 cameras, often receiving tens of thousands of events. Processing all
            this data uses a lot of compute - up to 480 cores and 500GB memory sometimes! - and even though we're using
            efficient "serverless" cloud computing, it can cost a much as Â£2500 per year just for data processing and
            storage. We
            are continually looking to reduce this cost, but at the same time we're gaining new cameras, so its a
            constant battle!
            Additionally, groups.io costs us $220 per year and is likely to increase due to growth in membership. In the
            past we have also incurred costs on publicity and outreach, and we'd like to do more of this.
