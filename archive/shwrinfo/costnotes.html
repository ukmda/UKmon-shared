Notes<br>
<li>During meteor showers, the cost of solving trajectories rises in proportion to the number of detections. </li>
<li>Costs rise from August to December as there are more meteor showers in this period. </li>
<li>Amounts of less than $0.10 per day are consolidated under Other. </li>
<li>AWS cost data may lag by up to a day, so yesterday's costs data are incomplete. </li>
