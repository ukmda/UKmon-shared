Notes<br>
Costs are split between three AWS accounts:
<li>Account starting with 317 hosts the batch server.</li>
<li>Account starting with 822 hosts the daily data and livestream data, and hosts the websites.</li>
<li>Account starting with 183 hosts the trajectory solver and report generator, as well as a complete data backup.</li>

During meteor showers, the cost of solving trajectories rises in proportion to the number of detections.
