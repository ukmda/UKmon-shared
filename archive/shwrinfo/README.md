# Shwrinfo

This folder contains short text descriptions of each shower. This information is put into a header on the shower report pages. There's also a brief description that appears on the cost report. 
To add new showers, copy the template, fill in the details and save it as "showercode.txt" eg "PER.txt" for the Perseids. Then deploy it to the batch server where it'll be picked up during reporting.
